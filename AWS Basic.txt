AWS Basic

Create Administrators group (AWS CLI)

First go to the AWS IAN site. 
Create Group called admin
- Make sure the group has ad privillges 
- Make sure you create a password and click the box new user must creat a passsword

Now you created the Group

Create Admin User

Select Create User
- Follow steps on GUI

From command line: Make sure you have installed AWS installer currently I have aws-cli/2.1.14 Py/3.7.9
Once that is downloaded find you user that you created on the IAM GUI 
- Find : Access Key ID
- Find : Secret Access Key

Now go to CMLine:

c:> aws configure 
- Access Key ID __
- Secret Access Key __
Other:

Now you are connected to your aws acount!!

Create a new group  with this command 

c:> aws iam creat-group --group-name Admin 

Boom should Work!!

List Group:
c: aws iam list-groups


Add policy to a group (Like AD): 
c: aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name Admins --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess

(You know it works when nothing happens)

Base:

c: aws iam 
- attach-group-policy
	- Add a group policy
	
--group-name <gname>
	- Asigned group

--policy-arn <policy aws path> (arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
	-- unknown
	
Check if worked!!
c: aws iam list-attached-group-policies --group-name Admins


Nice now that a group has been created now you have to add users!!

How to pick the right user access??

Check the box [] Programmatic access
// Only if the user needs to Make API calls, use AWS CLI, or Tools for Windows Powershell. 
// Then create Access key and Secret Access key 

Check the box [] AWS Managemett console access 
// Only if user needs access to AWS Management Console. 
// This Creates a password for the user

 When adding policys the best practice is to put USERS into GROUPS so you just give POLICYS to the GROUP
 rather than the Indivual.
 
 You can give indivual users policys but lets try not to at all cost. 
 
 ADD Tags to help define and ID the user
 
 Follow directions on GUI If using GUI
 
 If NOTTT!!!
